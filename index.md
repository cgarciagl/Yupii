Attention: **Yupii** is a package that transforms CodeIgniter into a Business Application Framework !!

## Installation

Download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/cgarciagl/Yupii/zipball/master) and unzip the files on your Codeigniter project directory.

Then open the **./application/config/routes.php** file and add this line at the end of the file:

```php
include_once(APPPATH.'third_party/yupii/config/autoload.php');
```
and That's it!, you can start to create your new great application!
